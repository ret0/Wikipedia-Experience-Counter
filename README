* Change Name of Article in XMLFetcher (main method)

* Finds the most recent 500 edits of an article, counts the number of edits
  by each of the users in this list of 500 edits
  
* Takes the 20 users that made the most changes to the article

* Calculates the "Experience" for each of these users and 
  prints these numbers to STDOUT
  
  
Possible Improvements:

* Fetch more than 500 revisions
* Fetch revisions in a date-range
* Do not execute HTTP Request for each user, bundle them
